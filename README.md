## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Express

Why was this stack chosen?

Node is a pretty lightweight server choice and can be spun up fairly easily. We needed a backend that could send a different response based on the result of another controller and the ability to dynamically render a .png file. By using Express' built in middleware architecture we could cleanly write fallbacks and we can build images using an API that's very similar to the front-end canvas API.

## Lessons Learned:

Learnt the use of Express & Heroku, makes building and deploying API's very easy

## Examples:
matcha
oolong
